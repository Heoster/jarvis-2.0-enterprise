## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Create New GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `jarvis-2.0-enterprise` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "JARVIS 2.0 Enterprise Edition - Advanced AI Assistant with Magical Personality"
   - Choose: Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Add GitHub remote** (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jarvis-2.0-enterprise.git
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Push to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

If prompted for credentials, you have two options:

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. Use token as password when pushing

### Option B: SSH Key
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Use SSH URL: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO.git`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Use Personal Access Token or SSH key (see Authentication section)

### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Solution**: Check repository URL and ensure it exists on GitHub

### Issue: "Updates were rejected"
**Solution**: Pull first: `git pull origin main --rebase`, then push

### Issue: "Large files"
**Solution**: If you have large model files, consider using Git LFS:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.pkl"
```
