# Action Planning and Orchestration Implementation

## Overview

Implemented task 5 "Action planning and orchestration" with three core components:

1. **ActionPlanner** - Plans and decomposes user intents into executable actions
2. **DependencyResolver** - Resolves dependencies and determines optimal execution order
3. **ActionExecutor** - Executes actions with timeout, cancellation, and error handling

## Components

### ActionPlanner (`core/action_planner.py`)

- Decomposes complex intents into atomic actions
- Builds dependency graphs using networkx
- Prioritizes and orders actions
- Generates fallback plans for failure scenarios
- Optimizes plans for parallel execution

### DependencyResolver (`core/action_planner.py`)

- Resolves execution order based on dependencies
- Identifies independent actions for parallel execution
- Detects circular dependencies
- Groups actions into execution stages
- Validates dependency graphs

### ActionExecutor (`core/action_executor.py`)

- Base class for async action execution
- Timeout and cancellation support
- Execution result tracking and logging
- Parallel and sequential execution modes
- Complete action plan execution with dependency management

## Features

- **Intelligent Planning**: Automatically decomposes intents into optimal action sequences
- **Parallel Execution**: Identifies and executes independent actions concurrently
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback actions
- **Performance Optimization**: Estimates execution time and optimizes for speed
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new action types and handlers

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_action_planner.py`) with 15 tests covering:
- Intent planning for all categories
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Parallel action identification
- Action execution with timeout
- Plan optimization
- Error handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Demo

Created demo script (`examples/action_planning_demo.py`) demonstrating:
- Simple question handling
- Math calculations
- Complex commands
- Parallel execution optimization
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Requirements Satisfied

âœ“ Requirement 2.1: Intelligent Action Planning and Execution
  - Generates prioritized to-do lists of atomic actions
  - Determines action dependencies
  - Parallelizes independent actions
  - Executes actions autonomously in optimal order
