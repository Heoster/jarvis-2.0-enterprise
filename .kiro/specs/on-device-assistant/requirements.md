# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The On-Device Assistant is a next-generation, privacy-first AI system designed to surpass commercial assistants like Siri and Alexa through superior natural language understanding, lightning-fast response times, and comprehensive device control. The system processes real text using advanced NLP, retrieves information from multiple sources (memory, training data, scraped websites, APIs), and generates smart, friendly, context-aware responses. Built entirely on CPU-optimized Python libraries with minimal GPU usage, the assistant features robust voice control for complete device and browser management, intelligent activity monitoring (web and app usage), and sophisticated decision-making capabilities that classify inputs and execute multi-step action plans autonomously.
